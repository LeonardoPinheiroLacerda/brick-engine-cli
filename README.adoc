CLI to scaffold Brick Engine projects.

== Introduction

`brick-engine-cli` is a command-line tool designed to accelerate game development using the **Brick Engine**. It automates the creation of the project's initial structure, configures build tools and code quality settings, allowing you to start programming your game immediately.

== Installation and Usage

You can use this tool in two main ways:

=== 1. Use Without Installation (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started is using `npx`, which runs the latest version of the tool without requiring a global installation on your system:

[source,bash]
----
npx brick-engine-cli init <project-name>
----

=== 2. Global Installation

If you prefer to have the command permanently available in your terminal, you can install it globally via `npm`:

[source,bash]
----
npm install -g brick-engine-cli
----

After installation, you can use the command directly:

[source,bash]
----
brick-engine-cli init <project-name>
----

== Commands

=== `init <name>`

Initializes a new Brick Engine project in a directory with the provided name.

During the process, you will be asked about:
* Project description.
* Whether you want to use **ESLint** to ensure code quality.
* Whether you want to use **Prettier** for automatic formatting.

=== `publish`

Publishes your game to the Brick Engine platform.

Before uploading, this command automatically builds the project to generate an optimized bundle. Once uploaded, the game enters a review process before becoming publicly available.

During the execution, you will be prompted for:
* **Developer email**: Used to send notifications regarding the game's review status (approval or rejection).

Upon successful submission, the CLI outputs the Game ID, Version, Bundle URL, and the current status of the publication. The command also safely rejects duplicate publication attempts for the same version.

== Template Scripts

Generated projects come with the following scripts in `package.json`:

=== Development and Build
