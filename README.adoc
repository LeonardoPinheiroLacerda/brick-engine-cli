CLI to scaffold Brick Engine projects.

== Introduction

`brick-engine-cli` is a command-line tool designed to accelerate game development using the **Brick Engine**. It automates the creation of the project's initial structure, configures build tools and code quality settings, allowing you to start programming your game immediately.

== Installation and Usage

You can use this tool in two main ways:

=== 1. Use Without Installation (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started is using `npx`, which runs the latest version of the tool without requiring a global installation on your system:

[source,bash]
----
npx brick-engine-cli init <project-name>
----

=== 2. Global Installation

If you prefer to have the command permanently available in your terminal, you can install it globally via `npm`:

[source,bash]
----
npm install -g brick-engine-cli
----

After installation, you can use the command directly:

[source,bash]
----
brick-engine-cli init <project-name>
----

== Commands

=== `init <name>`

Initializes a new Brick Engine project in a directory with the provided name.

During the process, you will be asked about:
* Project description.
* Whether you want to use **ESLint** to ensure code quality.
* Whether you want to use **Prettier** for automatic formatting.

== Template Scripts

Generated projects come with the following scripts in `package.json`:
